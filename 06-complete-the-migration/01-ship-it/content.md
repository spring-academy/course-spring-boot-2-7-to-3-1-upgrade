It's been a long road. But, your application is almost upgraded. Almostâ€¦ You might be thinking, "No, it's upgraded!" In our opinion the work isn't done until it is in the Production environment.

So, let's get it into production.


## Path to Prod

The time has come to complete your delivery of the upgraded application. Working within your SDLC processes, change control, etc., you need to get your application to production.

Our version of this process would be automated, and only have human involvement for "Gate" reviews into environments beyond Development.

Although it's not the focus of this course, if your Path to Prod isn't automated, in our opinion, it _should_ be. We recommend "obsessing" about it! Every time you work that path, the outcome should be a "retrospective" about things that can be done to make it more automated, smoother, and faster. The ability to iterate, move features and bug fixes to production as fast as possible is the goal of Agile!

The work isn't done until your application has been promoted to, and is being operated within, the Production environment.
