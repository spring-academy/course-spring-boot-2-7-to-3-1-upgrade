Congratulations! You now have the knowledge, skills, and hands-on experience to tackle your own upgrade from Spring Boot 2.7 to 3.1!

## Accomplishments

- You learned how to clean up your build file and dependency management.
- You learned what to look for to deal with framework evolution over time.
- You dealt specifically with major breaking changes in a core component, like Spring Security.
- You learned the **SCAR** method to systematically and logically work through all the upgrade tasks mentioned above.
- You upgraded a real application from Spring Boot 2.7 to 3.1!

## Keep Learning

Both Java and Spring are continually evolving; on average new versions are dropping every 6 months or so. JDK 21 and Spring Boot 3.2 (along with the other core Spring upgrades) are not covered in this course and will certainly impact future upgrades. 

Spring is going to evolve to take advantage of the Project Loom, String Templates, Project CRaC, etc. -- all new features in the JDK. The steps taken during this course are setting you up to be able to adopt these new changes as your product timelines allow.
