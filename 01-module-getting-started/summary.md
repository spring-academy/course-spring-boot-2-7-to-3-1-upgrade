In this module you learned the basic steps to upgrade a Spring Boot Application.

1. _P_ - Prep
1. _A_ - Assess
1. _U_ - Update
1. _T_ - Test
1. _R_ - Release

You learned how to `Prep` for the upgrade, and performed the `Assess` step, getting the application into a `Known Good State`, documenting the initial baseline.
