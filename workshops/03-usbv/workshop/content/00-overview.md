In this lab we'll make the first steps in our Family Cash Card application upgrade: updating the Spring Boot Starter Parent version. The Spring Boot Starter Parent is the entry point or base upon which most Spring Boot applications are built, so it makes sense to start there.

We're keeping detailed notes of the baseline state of our application as we upgrade it. Take a look at `upgrade-notes.md` to review where we are now.
