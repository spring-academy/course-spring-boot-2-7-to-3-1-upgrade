Right now, the code is compiling and things look pretty good. But we have some housekeeping to do before we're out of the woods.

As we have in previous labs, let's update our baseline.

Open `upgrade-notes.md` and add a new section for the upgrade at the bottom of the file:

```editor:open-file
file: ~/exercises/upgrade-notes.md
```

```markdown
## Upgrade Spring Boot Parent Version

- Code Compiles, No Errors or Warnings
```

That's it for now!
