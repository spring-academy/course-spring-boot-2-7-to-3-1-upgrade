During the **Prep** phase of the upgrade we actually did some work related to Spring Security. We performed an interim upgrade to `5.8.x` release of Spring Security to make the transition to Spring Security 6 easier.

During this lab we'll be performing the upgrade/migration from that interim release to Spring Security 6.

## Review our Upgrade Notes

Before we begin, remember that we're keeping detailed notes of the baseline state of our application as we upgrade it. Take a look at `upgrade-notes.md` to review where we are now.
