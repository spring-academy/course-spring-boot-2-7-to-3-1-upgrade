At this point, you've upgraded to Spring Boot 3.1 and Spring Security 6.1. We just compiled and everything looks good.

Let's record our result in the `upgrade-notes.md` file.

Add a line in the `Upgrade Spring Security Version` section:

```editor:open-file
file: ~/exercises/upgrade-notes.md
```

```markdown
_Result:_ code compiles without errors or warnings
```

We did it!
