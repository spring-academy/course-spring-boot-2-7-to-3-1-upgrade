Don't forget, you want to disable or remove the `spring-boot-properties-migrator` before running this application in production.

The choice is yours (or perhaps it's your organization policy's choice) to either delete the dependency, or just comment it out for use during future Spring Boot upgrades.

```editor:select-matching-text
file: ~/exercises/pom.xml
text: "spring-boot-properties-migrator"
```

```xml
<!-- comment out or delete -->
<!-- <dependency> -->
    <!-- <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId> -->
    <!-- <artifactId>spring-boot-properties-migrator</artifactId> -->
    <!-- <scope>runtime</scope> -->
<!-- </dependency> -->
```
