In this lab you'll finally get your hands dirty and start upgrading our sample application.

But what is the application we'll upgrade?

## The Family Cash Card application

It helps to have a real-world style project work on. Throughout this course you'll be upgrading a fictional _Family Cash Card_ application. The application is a REST API built with Spring Boot that lets customers manage "cash cards", which are like debit cards that customers can use to make purchases.

Take a moment to get familiar with the codebase and application. Click the "click action" below to open the Editor and poke around a bit.

```dashboard:open-dashboard
name: Editor
```

In the `src/main/java/example/cashcard` directory you'll find classes typical for a Spring Boot REST API: a Controller, Repository, Application, domain object, and a security configuration.

```editor:open-file
file: ~/exercises/src/main/java/example/cashcard/CashCardApplication.java
```

You'll also find tests in `src/test/java/example/cashcard`

```editor:open-file
file: ~/exercises/src/test/java/example/cashcard/CashCardApplicationTests.java
```

When you're ready, let's start upgrading!
