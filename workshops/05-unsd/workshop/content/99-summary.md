In this lab you learned how to find and remove hard-coded _non_-Spring dependencies. In addition, you learned that sometimes we really do need a hard-coded dependency, and the best place to manage them is through Maven Properties.

Now all the `pom.xml` housekeeping done, or wait...is it? No! We forgot about our Spring Security override! Because everything appears to be working we aren't going to address that in this lab. We are going to look at Spring Security separately in another lesson.

Lets take moment and reflect. Our application has been upgraded to Spring Boot 3.1 and is compiling successfully. That is a huge milestone, congratulations!
